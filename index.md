### Background

In Square’s new engineer onboarding program, which we call NEO, we offer short
courses and lectures on a variety of tools that we use at Square. We started to
collect notes from our course on D3.js and found the notes were well-suited for
a tutorial — and worth sharing.

### Introduction

The tutorial provides a quick intro to [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), a Javascript
library for creating data visualizations in the browser. D3 is built on top of
common web standards like HTML, CSS, and SVG.

D3 makes web-based visualizations easier by "automating the hard bits you already
understand," as opposed to "hiding the hard
bits" (hat tip [@andy_matuschak][tweet]).

Again, the tutorial is _not_ a deep dive — we want you to learn _how_ to learn
D3 and gain a high-level understanding of this useful tool.

### Notes

The recent version of d3.js, v4, has some big breaks in the API from the
previous version (see all the details of the [v3-to-v4 transition][v3-v4] in the
D3 wiki). Since we expect this to be the future, and that people coming to learn
d3 would want to be up to date from the beginning, we have updated this tutorial
to work with the v4 version. We tagged the [v3 version][archive-v3] for
posterity.
