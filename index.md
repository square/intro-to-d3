### Background

In Square’s new engineer onboarding program, which we call NEO, we offer short
courses and lectures on a variety of tools that we use at Square. We started to
collect notes from our course on D3.js and found the notes were well-suited for
a tutorial — and worth sharing.

### Introduction

The tutorial provides a quick intro to [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), a Javascript
library for creating data visualizations in the browser. D3 is built on top of
common web standards like HTML, CSS, and SVG.

D3 makes web-based visualizations easier by "automating the hard bits you already
understand," as opposed to "hiding the hard
bits" (hat tip [@andy_matuschak][tweet]).

Again, the tutorial is _not_ a deep dive — we want you to learn _how_ to learn
D3 and gain a high-level understanding of this useful tool.

### Notes

Major version updates in D3 sometimes come with breaking API changes. We have updated this tutorial
to work with the D3 v5-v7. 

We tagged the [v3 version][archive-v3] and [v4 version][archive-v4] for
posterity.
