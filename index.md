### Background

In Square’s new engineer onboarding program, which we call NEO, we offer short
courses and lectures on a variety of tools that we use at Square. We started to
collect notes from our course on D3.js and found the notes were well-suited for
a tutorial — and worth sharing.

### Introduction

This course provides a quick intro to
[D3.js](http://d3js.org/), a Javascript library for creating data visualizations
in the browser. D3 is built on top of common web standards like HTML, CSS, and SVG.

D3 makes web-based visualizations easier by "automating the hard bits you already
understand," as opposed to "hiding the hard
bits" (hat tip [@andy_matuschak](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/365547794129358849)).

Again, the tutorial is _not_ a deep dive — we want you to learn _how_ to learn
D3 and gain a high-level understanding of this useful tool.
